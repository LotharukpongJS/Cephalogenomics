# Analysis of phylogenetic discordance

We noticed that some gene trees disagreed with the _Branchiostoma_-sister topology derived from our study. We therefore tested the level of phylogenetic discordance in our data.

## Distribution of quartet scores

## Internode certainty

## Analysis of the bootstrap support of the individual gene trees

## Likelihood-based phylogenetic signal in the supermatrix

## Polytomy test
